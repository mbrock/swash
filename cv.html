Software developer in love with functional programming, Unix and the web.
Ten years' interest in Haskell -- fascinated by its enterprise use.

<b>Info.</b>       Living in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Interested in remote work,
            willing to relocate.  Aged 24, working my first job, quite
            enjoying it, but wanting something more challenging and
            relevant to my interests.  Really love the craft.

<b>Education.</b>  M.Sc. in Computer Science from Gothenburg University.
            <i>Finishing; waiting for final thesis approval.</i>

            My thesis dealt with adding an LLVM backend to Bigloo Scheme.

            I took classes on compiler construction (using Haskell),
            type systems, models of computation, abstract algebra,
            logic, and the usual algorithms & data structures.

<b>Work.</b>       2012&ndash;now at CompuGroup Medical Sweden AB.
            Java developer on web-based medical record system.

            Working in a Scrum team, both server and client tasks.
            We do lots of pair programming and TDD.

            Since January responsible for client-side architecture.
            Working on introducing guidelines and practices for maintainable
            JavaScript development.

            Held an appreciated presentation about object-oriented JS.

            Took initiative in quickly building a "test bench" tool for
            the test team to easier verify a particular integration.

<b>Skills.</b>     Haskell, C, JavaScript (and Node.js), C++, Ruby, Lisp, etc.
            Web, Unix, git, Emacs.
            Agile, prototyping, refactoring, testing.
            Decent understanding of compilers, linkers, kernels, etc.
            Math-literate, comfortable with abstraction and rigor.

<b>Projects.</b>   Some examples of hobby projects:

            <i>Yggdrasil</i>                   <a href="https://github.com/mbrock/yggdrasil">https://github.com/mbrock/yggdrasil</a>
              Haskell, Go, CoffeeScript.
              Real-time web forum with nested threads.
              Experiment with "event sourcing" as storage philosophy.

            <i>Schume</i>                         <a href="https://github.com/mbrock/schume">https://github.com/mbrock/schume</a>
              Haskell.
              A simple compiler and bytecode VM for a Scheme-like
              language with S-expressions, lambdas, and CALL/CC.
              Uses the Uniplate library for AST traversal.

            <i>HBEAM</i>                           <a href="https://github.com/mbrock/HBEAM">https://github.com/mbrock/HBEAM</a>
              Haskell, a little Ruby.
              An interpreter for a subset of Erlang's BEAM bytecode,
              supporting basic control flow, arithmetic, processes,
              and messages.  Uses GHC threads, STM, monad transformers.

            <i>node-goulash</i>            <a href="https://github.com/mbrock/node-goulash">https://github.com/mbrock/node-goulash</a>
              JavaScript, Node.js.
              An experiment for learning Node.js.  Tried various things
              like dependency injection, structured logging, event sourcing,
              promises, Mocha & Cucumber, etc.

            <i>Jambos</i>                        <a href="https://github.com/mbrock/jambos">https://github.com/mbrock/jambos</a>
              C++, x86-64 assembly.
              A toy kernel.  Experiment to learn about x86-64 long mode
              and to try C++ kernel development.  Doesn't do much.

<b>Hobbies.</b>    Aside from hacking, I play the guitar and sing, do Zen
            meditation with a local community, read & write, drink tea,
            and take photos.
